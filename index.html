        proceeding in "whole tones" and a row of
        non-black keys that does the same transposed by a
        "half tone". Hence, the principle is the same
        as that of Paul Jankó (see below), with the difference
        that the same fingering can only be used for 6 keys
        without the need to change.&nbsp; <p>For modifiying the
        keyboard I directly ordered spare parts from the
        manufacturer F.A.T.A.R. in Recanati (Italy) - mainly 44
        D-keys, in which Mrs. Heller kindly helped me very much.
        Furthermore an EPROM needed to be patched, to which Mr.
        Döpfer gave me the decisive hint (there is a table with
        black and white keys ...). </p>

        The <a href="http://www.electronic-mall.com/heavenbound/">Monolith</a>
        offers chromatic key rows that are placed one over the
        other. So it is related to the Riday T-91. However it
        amalgates several linear keyboards into one instrument by
        setting them closely together, thus enabling a player to
        play on several "virtual" synthesizers at a
        time with a single hand.</td>

        Microzone products have keyboards, that resemble the
        honeycombed ones of Johannes Beyreuther. In contrast to
        those, the black-and-white coloring corresponds to
        classical piano keyboards. Similar to the Monolith,
        several key rows are placed one over the other to add
        further possibilities of musical expression to that of
        pitch in a 2. dimension.</td>
