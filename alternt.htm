<h1 align="left">Incomplete List of Inventors of Alternative Keyboards</h1>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Laurence Claud Capper</strong> and <strong>Richard
        John Capper</strong> from Newsouthwales (Australia) had
        their invention of a piano keyboard applied for a patent
        on <a href="capper.jpg">1978 december 7</a> at the German
        Patent Office in Munich.</li>
    <li><strong>Gustav Karcher</strong> from Kuppenheim (Germany)
        did it <a href="karcher.jpg">1980 may 14</a>. He gave
        concerts on his modified keyboard, a lecture at the
        Musikhochschule Stuttgart, an interview at the
        Südwestfunk and he tried to convince a piano
        manufacturer in Braunschweig to produce corresponding
        pianos. Unfortunately his work has nearly been forgotten
        nowadays.</li>
    <li><strong>Gerhard Marhold</strong> from Berlin applied his
        invention for a patent on <a href="marhold.jpg">1985
        march 22</a> at the German Patent Office in Munich. The tonal network <b>Componet
      </b>is one of his most practicable proposals. There, fifths and thirds are
      drawn into 2 different directions of the plane starting at a tonica called
      &quot;0&quot;. A network is built by repeatedly applying fifth and third
      elements. The knots in the network are the notes, for which Gerhard Marhold
      used 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,X,L as label (instead of C to B). <a href="scales.gif">Scales</a>
      or <a href="chords.gif">chords</a> can be illustrated very well in there.

<blockquote>
  <p><small>This concept</small><small> could be extended </small><small>by the
  octaves</small><small> in a 3. dimension. The different topologies of e.g.
  pythagorean and equal temperature could thus be illustrated even better</small><small>.</small></p>

    </li>
    <li><strong>Hassani Ramin</strong> did it <a
        href="hassani.jpg">1987 september 1</a> in Munich. </li>
    <li>Last not least the work of <strong>Johannes Beyreuther</strong>
        must be acknowledged particularly. In addition to
        accordions with honeycombed keys, so-called harmophones and
        <a href="beypiano.jpg">modified piano keyboards</a> are
        on his account. He received:<ol>
            <li>the big gold medal on the inventors' fair in
                Vienna.</li>
            <li>the gold medal of the 20. international <a
                href="beymesse.jpg">inventors fair in Brussels</a>.</li>
            <li>the Norwegian inventor's gold medal 1971.</li>
            <li>the consolation prize of the Austrian ministry
                for science and research.</li>
            <li>a medal for excellent performance on the
                inventors and news show in Frankfurt am Main
                1970.</li>
            <li>the gold medal at the Internemo in Oberhausen
                1970.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Johannes Beyreuther operates a music school in
        Kolbermoor (Bavaria) and teaches there on alternative
        keyboards with the aid of his rationalized music notation.
        The learning results of children are excellent.</p>
      <p>A short interview was printed in the German <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/shop">Spiegel</a>
      4/2000.</p>
