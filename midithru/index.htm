<h1>Mad Harry's MIDI Through V1.0</h1>

<ul>
    <li>runs on Palm OS version 3 or higher.</li>
    <li>tested on Palm OS 3.5 and Palm m105.</li>
    <li>needs MIDI In &amp; Out at the serial interface or the
        RS-232 part of the universal connector (several assembly
        instructions in the WWW or below).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="midithru.gif" align="right" border="1" hspace="10"

file midithru.prc with the Palm Installer.</p>

<p>The application simply forwards data from the serial
interface's input to its output. The baud rate can be adjusted.
The number of data bits is fixed to 8, the number of stop bits to
1. Parity is off. </p>

<p>A simple monitor shows the bytes received as hexadecimal
numbers. For performance optimization the monitor can be
disabled. However the application was optimized for maximum
throuput either. A chromatic test sequence consisting of one
half-second long note per MIDI channel can be triggered. Receive
and send errors on the serial interface are indicated. All
settings are stored persitently.</p>

<p>This application is a pilot project for porting the MIDI
Enhancer from TOS to Palm OS.</p>

<h1>My simple MIDI interface for the Palm</h1>

with my Palm m105. The 6 parts fitted into a standard 9 pin
RS-232 jack.</p>

<p>For the diodes you can take nearly any type. If your synth's
MIDI out is weak, you may decrease the 220 Ohm resistor down to
120 Ohm. The 680 Ohm resistor I found out experimentally. 900 Ohm
may work also at its place, saving a little bit battery power.
960 Ohm lead to receive errors on the m105's serial interface.You
also may try to increase the 330 Ohm resistor to optimize power
consumption. The exact type of the optocoupler seems not to be
critical.</p>
