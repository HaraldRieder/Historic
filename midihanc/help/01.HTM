<h1><a name="Introduction">1 Introduction</a></h1>
<p>The MIDI Enhancer allows you to play microtonal music on
conventional synthesizers supporting the MIDI poly mode (multi mode)
and on GS compatible MIDI instruments (consult the manual to find out
whether your instrument is GS compatible - GM compatibility does not
include GS compatibility).
</p>
<p>With the MIDI Enhancer you get a number of ready-to-use scales,
like meantone, arabian and natural ones. You can change the scale
while playing, and you can change the harmonic context
(&quot;harmonizing note&quot;) without changing the scale type while
you are playing (e.g. you keep the scale type &quot;natural&quot; but
switch its base from C# to G#). The scale switches are smooth and take
into consideration the current context, unlike brute scale switches as
performed even by expensive commercial MIDI tools.
</p>
<p>Furthermore you get some additional &quot;kit features&quot; like
MIDI string sending and volumes mapping, that might be of interest for
you - or not. You even may use these kit features without needing to
enter the world of microtonalism.
