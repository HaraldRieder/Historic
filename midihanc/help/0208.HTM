<p>Here you can modify the note-on velocities of individual notes,
i.e. how the note-on velocity of a note received on the MIDI input of
the computer is transformed before it is sent to the MIDI output. The
note-on velocity usually controls the volume an/or cutoff frequency of
a sound. Purpose: correction of not 100% balanced keyboards and
adaptation of keyboards to expanders.
</p>
<ul>
<p><li> &quot;linear&quot; maps a note-on velocity on the inputs
linear to the outputs
</p>
<p><li> &quot;quadratic&quot; maps quadratically. I.e. you have to
press the keys more hard for higher note-on velocity values on the
outputs.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<p><li> &quot;fix minimum&quot; means that a velocity of 0 on an
input channel will always be mapped to a velocity of 0 on an output
channel.
</p>
<p><li> &quot;fix maximum&quot; means that a velocity of 127 on an
input channel will always be mapped to a velocity of 127 on an output
channel.
</p>
</ul>
<p>The <b>slope</b> of the mapping function can be adjusted per note
with the &quot;-&quot; and &quot;+&quot; buttons. All notes together
can be selected/deselected with the &quot;all&quot; button.
</p>
<p>Press &quot;Test&quot; to test your volumes mappings. Press any
key (on the computer keyboard) to exit test mode.
</p>
<p>The following diagrams explain which transformation curves can be
achieved:
