<h1><a name="The Controller Window">2.4 The Controller Window</a></h1>
<p>You can select one or more of the 16 MIDI channels, labelled with
0..F, as input sources. They will be modified by the control channel.
Only one channel can be control channel. The harmonizing channel
should not be an input channel, however, for first experiments you
might choose this.
</p>
<p>In pitch bend mode you also can enable each of the 16 output
channels individually. If your synthesizer reserves channel 10 for the
drums, disable the red arrow labelled with 9.
</p>
<p>The tuning table you already chose in the tuner window. With the
pythagorean tuning you might hear no difference to before, except one
ugly 7. With the clean tables you might feel, that some major and
minor chords sound compact and good, others not. All the new distances
and chords might sound quite unused to your ears.
</p>
<p>If you want to play a piece in a fixed key, you can select a key
with the corresponding cycle button. &quot;none&quot; means &quot;no
key selected&quot;. You need not to select any key. The MIDI Enhancer
will then work in an &quot;integrating&quot; mode. Pitch offset
overflows however can be avoided best by selecting a key.
</p>
<p>Harmonizer Modes:
</p>
<ul>
<p><li> &quot;autostart&quot; leads to an immediate MIDI processing
after program start. Tuner and Controller windows are opened in a way
that you can read the selected table and the controller settings.
</p>
<p><li> &quot;throu&quot; disables the harmonizer. All MIDI signals
are forwarded from input to output without modification.
</p>
<p><li> &quot;auto&quot; activates automatic mode. The harmonizer
tries to derive an optimum tuning for new notes from the notes already
played. On principle, this does not succeed very well. To find the
optimum tuning, the harmonizer would have to know, how the piece will
evolve in future. But, in contrast to a human interpreter, it only
knows the past. Try to look at this as a somehow experimental feature.
If the tuning &quot;slides away&quot; too fast, increase the
&quot;smoothing&quot; parameter. The MIDI Enhancer tries to reach a
clean tuning in this mode.
</p>
<p><li> if &quot;hold&quot; is checked, always the last harmonizing
note played on the control channel will be held. If it is not checked,
you can switch off the harmonizing by not playing any notes on the
harmonizing channel.
</p>
</ul>
<p>Getting started:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Choose a table with clean tuning (in the tuner window).
<li> Do not enter any valid key.
<li> Do not check &quot;hold&quot;.
<li> Press the &quot;start&quot; button !
</ul>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Play a major 0 chord on an input channel. It should sound as
usual. Now additionally play a 0 on the control channel. Do you hear
the difference ? A major 7 and a major 5 will sound good like the
major 0. Play a major 2 together with a 0 harmonizing note. Doesn't
this sound ugly ? You have to reharmonize by playing e.g. a 7, then
the major 2 sounds good again. Try a little bit ! Stop the harmonizer
by any key press (on the computer keyboard).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to enter a certain key, you need some experience. A 0
should be the best choice for most major 0 pieces. For a minor 0
piece, a 9 might be the better choice. Don't worry, if you have to
learn when and how to change the harmonizing note.
</p>
<p>For the MIDI experts:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the controller 16 on the control channel you can select a
tuning table. With the controller 17 you determine the key. Finally,
in the automatic mode controller 18 selects the smoothing time. Thus,
you need not to stand up and walk to your computer. Program changes
and foot switch controller changes appear replicated on each of the
ouput channels in pitch bend mode. After one program change command
the MIDI enhancer will change your synthesizer sounds on all enabled
output channels. In pitch bend mode, granularities of continous
controllers are first reduced by the MIDI Enhancer and then the less
controller change commands are forwarded to all enabled output
channels. Thus, all controllers will work, but not as fine as usual
(because of the limited MIDI bandwidth). Pitch bend will not work in
pitch bend mode. Channel pressure and bank selects should be
replicated in pitch bend mode, but since my keyboard does not send
them, these features were not tested.
</p>
