<h1><a name="The Program Change Mapper Window">2.7 The Program Change Mapper Window</a></h1>
<p>This window is intended for sending arbitrary MIDI strings to the
MIDI output of your computer triggered by program change messages on
the control channel. When the &quot;start&quot; button in the
Controller is down and a program change defined in the Program Change
Mapper is received on the control channel, the corresponding MIDI
string is sent to the MIDI output of your computer.
</p>
<p>A program change is defined for mapping, if its number can be
found in the left column of the Program Change Mapper window. For
example, if you enter a 112 in the left column and 13. row of the
program change mapper window, the MIDI string in the right column and
13. row will be sent whenever a program change of 112 is received on
the control channel of the MIDI input.
</p>
<p>Note that program change numbers reach from 0..127 here. If you
want to disable a row, enter nothing or blanks or anything else that
cannot be interpreted as number in the left field.
</p>
<p>Comments are allowed in the right column. They start with '#' or
';', all succeeding characters are ignored when sending the MIDI
string.
</p>
<p>Press &quot;Test&quot; to test your MIDI strings. The string of
the row where the text cursor is blinking will be sent to MIDI out of
your computer.
