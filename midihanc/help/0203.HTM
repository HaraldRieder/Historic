<h1><a name="The Tuner Window">2.3 The Tuner Window</a></h1>
<p>Here you design your scales by tuning the 11 distances in relation
to the harmonizing note. The scales are defined by <b>tables</b> that
assign cent values to each distance, except the distance 0 which
always has 0 cent and can not be modified. Pitch bend or Roland GS
compatible scale tune messages are sent out to modify the tuning.
</p>
<p>Pitch bend messages consist of 2 data bytes (a data byte is <b>7
bits</b> in the MIDI world). If you set up your synthesizer as
described above for pitch bend mode, a single pitch bend step should
be 1/(64*128) * 100 cent. Unfortunately most synthesizers through away
the least significant data byte, thus leading to a pitch bend accuracy
of 1/64 * 100 cent (This is still good enough, probably better than
you can hear).
</p>
<p>The most important cent values are fortunately known by the MIDI
Enhancer and can be retrieved with the &lt;=&lt;= and =&gt;=&gt;
buttons. The &quot;fits&quot; field follows this convention:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>starts with C:</b><dd> chromatic distance
<dt><b>starts with M:</b><dd> meantone distance
<dt><b>else:</b><dd> natural distance
</dl>
</p>
<p>The wide slider allows fine and free adjustment of cent values.
</p>
<p>When you select a distance for being tuned, it is made hearable on
the MIDI output. In scale tune mode, you will hear an example distance
on the test channel. In pitch bend mode, test channel and test channel
+ 1 are used to make the interval hearable.
</p>
<p>You can define up to 4 tuning tables. Each table may be named. The
reason for the low number of tables is, that you can select a table
via MIDI controller 16. And even if the knob belonging to the
controller does not have a scale, in a live performance you will be
able to imagine 4 ranges by simply looking at the knob.
</p>
<p>With the &quot;Export&quot; and &quot;Import&quot; buttons you can
load and save individual tables as human readable .txt files. You can
also drag a file from a file manager and drop it onto the table's name
field to import it.
</p>
<p>All buttons can also be reached from the keyboard, pressing
additionally the Alternate key, the tables can be selected with
Control plus 0..3.
