*Historic internet content about alternative keyboard instruments, music notation and more...*

This is the content of my first home page, originally hosted at Tripod, finally at Ionos until the year of 2023. 
I also had a Wikimedia running on vermaschung.de. There I had a page about Roland Juno-D controllers. 

All together can be accessed [here](https://haraldrieder.github.io/Historic/) (GitHub pages).
